        <p class="sectionTag">What is Mental Health?</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag">Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community.Furthermore, refers to your overall emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It impacts how you think, feel, behave, and go about your daily life. Having good mental health doesn't mean feeling amazing 24/7 - everyone experiences ups and downs. But it does mean you're able to cope with normal stresses, be productive in areas like school or work, have fulfilling relationships, and live your life in a positive and meaningful way. Poor mental health can look like persistent sadness, anxiety, anger, difficulties handling stress, social withdrawal, lack of motivation, and more.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag">Why does it matter?</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag">Mental health struggles often begin during the teenage and young adult years. The ages of 13-25 are a period of major life transitions like puberty, increasing independence and responsibilities, establishing identity, and more. These can create a perfect storm of stressors that impact mental health. Poor mental health in these formative years can derail academic performance, social development, and set the stage for challenges later in life. That's why it's so crucial to prioritize mental health early. By developing healthy coping strategies and getting support for any issues now, you build resilience for the future. Mental health doesn't just start mattering later - nurturing it from adolescence allows you to establish firm roots for lifelong wellbeing.</p>
